RENTING

In addition to the **cost of purchasing the apartment**, **furniture**, and the **notary fees**, there are several other **ongoing costs** and **initial expenses** you'll need to consider when renting out an apartment. If you hire a **property management agency** to take care of things for you, this will also come with a cost. Here’s a breakdown of the potential expenses:

### **1. Property Management Agency Fees**
If you decide to hire a **property management company** to handle the day-to-day tasks (like tenant finding, rent collection, maintenance, etc.), here’s what you can expect:
- **Property Management Fees**: These usually range between **10% to 20%** of the monthly rent, depending on the services offered. For example:
  - If you rent the apartment for **2,000 RON/month**, the management company might charge between **200 RON to 400 RON/month** for their services.
  - The fee covers tasks like tenant sourcing, screening, lease signing, and ongoing maintenance management.
  
### **2. Maintenance and Repairs**
You’ll need to budget for **regular maintenance** and **emergency repairs**. These costs will vary depending on the size and condition of the apartment, but here are some possible expenses:
- **Regular Maintenance**: 
  - **Cleaning**: If you don’t want to clean the apartment between tenants, you can hire a cleaning service, which typically costs between **150 RON - 300 RON** for a standard cleaning session.
  - **Common Area Maintenance**: If the apartment is part of a building with shared areas (e.g., hallways, elevator), you might need to contribute to **common area maintenance fees**, which could range from **50 RON - 200 RON/month** depending on the building.
  
- **Repairs**: Occasionally, there will be issues such as plumbing problems, electrical malfunctions, or appliance breakdowns.
  - **Plumbing or Electrical Repairs**: These can cost between **200 RON - 1,000 RON**, depending on the issue.
  - **Appliance Repairs or Replacements**: If any major appliance like a fridge, stove, or washing machine breaks, you’ll need to factor in these costs. Replacing a refrigerator could cost between **1,000 RON - 2,500 RON**, depending on the brand and model.

### **3. Property Taxes**
In Romania, property taxes are an **annual** cost and are calculated based on the value of the property. These taxes are paid **once a year** and usually cost:
- **Property Tax**: Typically around **0.08% to 0.2%** of the property’s value, depending on the city. For example:
  - For an apartment valued at **100,000 RON**, the property tax would be **80 RON - 200 RON/year**.

### **4. Insurance**
It's advisable to take out property insurance to protect against any potential risks such as fire, flood, or tenant damage.
- **Property Insurance**: The cost typically ranges from **200 RON to 1,000 RON/year**, depending on the coverage and value of your apartment.
  - For a standard apartment, expect to pay around **300 RON to 500 RON/year** for a basic policy.

### **5. Utilities (Optional)**
Depending on how you set up the rental agreement, you might need to pay for utilities, or tenants may be responsible for them. Here are some costs to consider:
- **Water, Electricity, Gas, Internet**: If you decide to include utilities in the rent, the average monthly cost for all utilities might be around **300 RON - 600 RON/month** for a one-bedroom apartment. However, if tenants pay for these separately, this wouldn't be your responsibility.
  - For example, **water** might cost **50 RON - 100 RON/month**, **electricity** could be **100 RON - 200 RON/month**, and **internet** usually runs around **30 RON - 50 RON/month**.

### **6. Advertising and Tenant Search (if not using a Property Management Agency)**
If you choose to manage the property on your own, you may need to advertise the apartment for rent, either online or through print ads.
- **Online Ads**: Advertising on platforms like **Olx.ro** or **Imobiliare.ro** is generally free or has a small fee for premium listings. Premium listings could cost between **50 RON - 150 RON** per month.
- **Print Ads**: If you opt for print advertising (local newspapers, etc.), the cost could vary from **100 RON to 500 RON**, depending on the publication and reach.

### **7. Annual Taxes on Rental Income**
You must report your rental income to **ANAF (the National Agency for Fiscal Administration)** in Romania. You will be taxed on your rental income at a rate of **10%** after allowable expenses. For example:
- If your apartment brings in **2,000 RON/month** (24,000 RON/year) in rent, you’ll need to pay **10% tax** on the **net income** (after deducting expenses like property maintenance and management fees).

### **Final Notes**:
The amount you’ll need to spend depends on several factors, including the location of the property, the quality of the apartment, and whether you manage everything yourself or use a property management agency. For someone just starting out, it’s often recommended to use an agency to avoid headaches, especially if you have other obligations.

Once you've considered these ongoing costs, you’ll have a clearer picture of your potential **passive income**. Generally, after all costs, your monthly rental income can still be a **profitable venture**, especially in high-demand areas.

CONTRACT

Yes, you can include various provisions in the **rental contract** to shift certain responsibilities onto the tenant, which can help reduce your costs. However, it’s important to approach this carefully, as some provisions might be **unreasonable or unenforceable**, and can potentially lead to conflicts or tenants refusing to rent the property. Below are some things you can include in the contract and what is generally acceptable:

### **1. Responsibility for Maintenance and Repairs**
You can include clauses in the contract specifying which repairs the tenant is responsible for and which are your responsibility as the landlord. However, it's important to distinguish between **minor repairs** and **major repairs**.

#### **What You Can Shift to the Tenant**:
- **Minor Repairs**: For small maintenance issues, like replacing light bulbs, cleaning, or minor plumbing (e.g., fixing a clogged drain), you can stipulate that the tenant is responsible.
- **Cosmetic Repairs**: You could also specify that tenants are responsible for any **cosmetic damages**, such as damage to paint, flooring, or furniture (if the apartment is furnished). If a tenant spills something or damages a wall, they should repair or cover the cost.

#### **What You Should Retain Responsibility For**:
- **Major Repairs**: Structural repairs (e.g., fixing the roof, repairing cracks in the walls) and repairs to essential systems (e.g., plumbing, electrical systems, heating) are usually **the landlord's responsibility**, as these are considered essential for living in the apartment.
- **Appliance Failures**: For things like a broken **fridge**, **washing machine**, or **air conditioning**, it's typically expected that the landlord will replace or repair them, unless the tenant caused the damage through misuse.
- **Safety and Habitability**: The landlord is responsible for maintaining the apartment in a habitable condition, which includes ensuring that the apartment complies with safety standards (e.g., fire safety, plumbing, and electricity). You cannot pass this responsibility to the tenant.

### **2. Damage to Property**
You can specify in the contract that the **tenant must pay for any damage they cause** to the property, beyond normal wear and tear. This includes:
- **Broken furniture** (if the apartment is furnished),
- **Damaged walls** (e.g., holes or significant scratches),
- **Missing appliances** or parts (e.g., if something gets stolen or damaged due to tenant negligence).

**Security Deposit**: To make this enforceable, you'll need to request a **security deposit** (usually 1-2 months’ rent). This deposit can be used to cover damages caused by the tenant, and it can be returned when the tenant moves out, assuming there’s no damage.

#### **Example Clause**:  
_"The tenant is responsible for any damage caused to the property, including but not limited to damage to walls, flooring, and furniture (if furnished), beyond normal wear and tear. In such cases, the tenant agrees to cover the cost of repairs or replacement. The security deposit will be used for any damages and will be refunded upon inspection of the apartment at the end of the lease term."_

### **3. Utilities**
You can include a clause in the contract specifying who is responsible for paying the **utilities** (e.g., water, electricity, gas, internet, etc.). You can either:
- **Pass utilities onto the tenant**: The tenant will pay all utilities directly, and you can just include this in the contract.
  - For example, you can say: _"The tenant is responsible for all utility payments, including water, electricity, gas, and internet. The landlord will not be responsible for these costs."_
- **Include utilities in the rent**: If you want to include utilities in the rent, make sure you factor in the average costs into the rent price.

### **4. Cleaning**
You can specify that tenants are responsible for keeping the apartment clean and that they must return it in good condition at the end of the lease. You might also want to specify whether they need to hire a cleaning service when they move out, especially if the apartment is furnished.
  
For example, a clause like:  
_"The tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and in good condition throughout the duration of the lease. Upon vacating the apartment, the tenant must ensure it is cleaned and returned in the same condition as when they moved in, with the exception of normal wear and tear."_

### **5. Pest Control**
Pest control can be a gray area. Usually, pest control falls under the landlord’s responsibility, especially for things like **mice**, **cockroaches**, or other infestations, as they are often due to the building's age or conditions outside the tenant’s control.

However, if the tenant brings in pets or creates conditions that attract pests (e.g., leaving food lying around), you can include a clause that makes the tenant responsible for **preventing pest infestations** or paying for pest control caused by their negligence.

### **6. Insurance**
You can **encourage** tenants to take out **tenant’s insurance** (which is relatively cheap and covers their personal property) but you **cannot require it** unless the local laws dictate otherwise.

If you're renting a furnished apartment, it's a good idea to state that tenants should insure their personal belongings, and you can offer to help them with this.

### **7. What Should Be Avoided**
While you can shift many responsibilities to the tenant, there are certain things you should avoid:
- **Unreasonable clauses**: For example, if you try to make the tenant responsible for things that are beyond their control (e.g., a building’s plumbing system breaking), it might be considered **unfair** or **unenforceable** by a court.
- **Health and safety**: You cannot pass the responsibility for maintaining the apartment in a habitable condition to the tenant. This includes things like making sure the property is free of mold, the heating works, and plumbing is functional.
  
### **Final Thoughts**
It’s possible to shift some costs and responsibilities onto the tenant, but it's important that the clauses are **reasonable**, **clear**, and **enforceable**. The rental agreement should strike a balance that protects both you and your tenant’s interests. When in doubt, you might want to have a lawyer or notary review your rental contract to ensure it complies with Romanian laws and is fair to both parties.

If you're unsure about what can and can't be included in your rental agreement, or if you want to make sure your contract is bulletproof, it's always a good idea to consult with a lawyer specializing in rental law.
